### Writing code with the Test Driven Development approach

In this assignment there was a good description of what we expect the code to output with a given input.
We then had to write the tests for all testcases and different types of input/ input values.
Only then would we create the functions and let the tests run.
From the results we then had to make alterations to the code so that all tests would eventually pass.

### Conclusion

This proved to be a suprisingly good way to write code when you don't know in advance what the end product should be, 
but you know what to expect your functions to do.
